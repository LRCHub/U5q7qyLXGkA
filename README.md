[00:09.45] Voilà!
[00:11.29] Mes amis, here's Paris.
[00:15.18] Now that we're here, follow me.
[00:19.43] Begin with the view
[00:21.36] As you stroll down la rue.
[00:34.36] 
[00:23.90] And soon all Paris
[00:25.77] Will be singing to you.
[00:37.27] 
[00:27.88] Oooh
[00:33.12] Aah, Aaaah
[00:38.12] 
[00:36.97] Paris holds the key to your heart
[00:41.70] And all of Paris plays a part.
[00:46.25] Paris' turned a page
[00:47.94] To the new modern age.
[00:58.94] 
[00:50.35] And we'll do it too if we're smart!
[01:07.85] 
[00:54.87] The French have it down to an art.
[01:11.87] 
[01:01.27] Everyone's a writer, painter, poet.
[01:05.84] Everything is avant garde
[01:08.57] Or chic.
[01:12.57] 
[01:10.47] We'll be in the know
[01:11.89] Before we know it.
[01:20.89] 
[01:15.03] When you're in the know it's-
[01:16.93] Oh, it's magnifique
[01:19.79] To find in Paris what you seek.
[01:35.29] 
[01:38.56] Paris holds the key to her fate.
[01:44.72] We won't have much longer to wait
[01:48.97] And then come what may
[01:51.32] We will each go our way...
[02:04.32] 
[01:54.56] I dreamed of a city beyond all compare
[01:59.50] It's hard to believe that I'm finally there.
[02:21.50] 
[02:04.07] At last, there's a future.
[02:06.13] There's freedom.
[02:07.36] There's hope.
[02:08.16] In the air!
[02:13.66] 
[02:16.21] Paris holds the key to your heart
[02:21.89] The pleasures of life à la carte
[02:26.03] Come dance through the night
[02:28.13] And forget all your woes
[02:30.57] The city of light
[02:32.63] How it glitters and glows
[02:35.23] And one never knows what will start
[02:46.14] Paris holds the key to your heart!
